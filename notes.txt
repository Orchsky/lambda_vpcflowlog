Serverless 

1. What is serverless? AWS handles, controls servers for us. 
2. Main benefit of serverless/AWS Lambda? You don't have to worry about configuring runtime environments 
and all you need to do is just simply select the runtime environments

Scenario: Per company's requirement vpc flowlogs must always enabled. For example make sure during 
vpc flowlog deletion your automations script must recreate it. What will be your solution?
Event driven solution with AWS Lambda.

1. aws iam create-role --role-name VPCFlowLogsRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
2. aws iam put-role-policy --role-name VPCFlowLogsRole --policy-name VPCFlowLogsPolicy --policy-document file://vpc-flow-logs-iam-role.json
3. Create Lambda execution policy --> lambda_execution_policy.json --> AWS IAM console
4. Create IAM role and attach lambda_execution_policy.json to the role 
5. AWS Lambda console give Lambda function name, select Python 3.7 runtime and attach role to lambda function
